//vsco: width == 1012 kicks into displaying 5 in a row
//      width ==  768 kicks into displaying 4 in a row
//      width ==  543 kicks into displaying 3 in a row
//    Each column has display:grid; There exists a container of the columns that
//      has the same display property. The width of these columns sets the width
//      of the images via percentages and application of max-width.

// . Do a preliminary load of n images, where n is the max amount of columns.
// . Calculate the height of the smallest column
//      - This is a compound measurement of the height values of each image
//          within the column.
// . When a resize occurs which adds a new column, recalculate height of the
//      smallest column.
//      - Rebucket the images in the grid with respect to new quantity of cols
// . When the viewport is determined to be at a point where more images should
//      be loaded, add the next image to the col with the smallest height, re-
//      calculate the smallest column.

//I want to have fade-in animations for the new images being loaded. This can
//  be accomplished by creating a new figure tag whose display is initially set
//  to none.

//Would like to have a buffer of images loaded in which aren't displayed, and
//  the view-port trigger displays these images then loads in a new buffer.

//Need to consider the images.json file with respect to finding the order to
//  to load in these images. Should also create my own manifest datastructure.
