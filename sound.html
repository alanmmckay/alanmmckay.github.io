                        Seven years ago I woke up looking at a moving hospital ceiling. I was being carted in, voices sounding off around me; all informing eachother information pertaining to what they know of my status and how to find out more. I calmly asked, "Where am I?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A female voice informs me that I'm in the hospital and that I had been hit by a car while cycling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the imagery of the hospital cieling, it is the sound of the hustle and bustle within the emergency room that I remember most. The wheels of the gurney, the cutting of the scissors and the resultant tearing of fabric as my clothing was removed, the blips and whirs of the sensory machinery and the voices of the doctors and nurses all communicating the state of affairs. All sounds that echoed through the chambers of the hospital; each new room affecting the vibrancy of these noises in different ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't remember the accident. The last image I remember is that of a pickup truck cresting a hill half a mile away. I was hit by car - an Oldsmobile 88. The truck is simply a quaint image in my mind, inconsequential to the accident. I remember what I was listening to, though. The driving music that allows me to soar while cycling. It was a radio playlist of the Jungle subgenre recorded from the radio waves of london during the mid 90's. I believe that the song playing was Peshay's "On the Nile".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where there was a void of conciousness the music kept flowing into existence. My subconcious mind soaking up the beautiful unintrusive sounds. There is a lapse in time during my life, but I remember that these sounds continued; I remember it fondly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the music stopped, I came out of this void. I'm unsure if it was because they took my headphones out; I don't know at what point in time they were removed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing for certain is that this persistent sound kept me calm when I came back. The sound played a part in the fact I felt like I had just woken up from the best sleep of my life.

                        The accident occurred during the first semester in which I was back in college. The accident helped provide motivation to obtain my AAS in Web Development and Programming. The motiviation carried on towards my earning a BS in Computer Science. As of this writing, I am working on an MCS of Computer Science. Motivation has taken me to the University of Iowa, a school known for medical pursuits.

                        One aspect of my routine is to spend time at the steps of the old capitol building here in Iowa City. I do this as a means to find individuals whom are willing to connect. It also is a good spot for mindful meditation as the breeze easily collects upon the steps.

                        The sound of the hospital helicopter occasionally echos throughout the valley that these steps overlook. Before my education had taken me to the campus grounds, I had visited the hospital across the river. I remember the sounds of the helicopter engine and rotor without the associated doppler. A constant hum from the interior cabin as I was taken to the same hospital rooftop that I now regularily look upon. A precautionary trip on account of my restful loss of conciousness.

                        During my undergrad education, I found it difficult to connect with the peers who were studying what I was. I did find myself leaning towards mucisians, though. Two of the most meaningful friendships I formed were with two mucisians, Aaron and Clayton. Many fond memories of either picking away at their guitars and humming a tune and providing a good atmosphere to exist in.

                        This fact still holds true during my first year of graduate school. I'm finding it difficult to connect with my peers. I've only recently been discovering pockets of arists and musicians alike.

                        A few Thursdays ago, I had to proctor a test. The sun had set by the time this task was complete; an event which I prefer to witness upon the steps. I decided to walk by to see if anyone had stuck around. Arriving, I heard the resonant drone of two guitars, one amplified. The reverb struck a chord in me - a very warm sound which reminded me of Caspian's album "You are the Conductor".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I climbed the steps past two gentlemen who were playing and humming.  A peaceful twenty minutes ensued as we overlooked the valley. About ten minutes in, the sound of a helicopter bounced around the environment as it passed overhead towards the hospital rooftop. The calming sounds produced by the two men aleviated any anxiety on my part; it was okay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When they concluded, I approached them and told them that I really appreciated the sounds they were putting out. I told them that I hoped that they would gather again. They appreciated this. We briefly exchanged names. Their names were Mike and Sean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I parted ways after the brief verbal interaction. I headed to the local Kombucha bar and had a nice conversation with a new acquaintence. A psychiatrist who works at the university hospital. Our discussions are always insightful and meaningful. Never a too brief verbal interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon the conclusion, she steps away. I sit in silence for a moment. And in walks a man with a guitar on his back and a portable amp in hand. He says, "Hello Alan".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Hello Sean," I respond. <br>
                        He follows up by saying, "You get a second show."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sean asks the the barkeep if he can play in the store. Of course, Connor says yes. <br>
                        What followed is another hour and a half of the soft, warm, and powerful sounds of Sean and his guitar while Connor and I witnessed this warm moment in time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only one time before in my life had I felt so at ease; only one time before had I felt well rested from sound.

                        The connectivity of sound is something I'm still exploring. I think there is some primal escence that is too easy to neglect in our lives; lives where it is too easy to categorize one thing from another. I've before described a person as both visually and aurally noisy. I would describe Sean, pictured above, as both visually and aurally sound.
